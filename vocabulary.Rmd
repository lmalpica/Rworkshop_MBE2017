# Vocabulary 

For more vocabulary check Hadley Wickham from his excellent book *Advanced R* <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html>:

I encourage you to look through Hadley's full list at the link above. 

Below, find Hadley's list to those most relevant to this workshop. It will help you follow the material if you are at least somewhat aware of the following functions and their purpose.

## The basics

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The first functions to learn
?
str

# Important operators and assignment
%in%
$, [, [[, head, tail, subset

# Comparison 
!=, ==, >, >=, <, <=
is.na

# Basic math
*, +, -, /, ^
abs
ceiling, floor, round
exp, log, log10, log2, sqrt

max, min, prod, sum
range
mean, median, cor, sd, var

# Logical & sets 
&, |, !, xor
all, any
which

# Vectors and matrices
c, matrix
length, dim, ncol, nrow
cbind, rbind
names, colnames, rownames

# Making vectors 
c
rep, rep_len
seq, seq_len, seq_along
rev
sample
(is/as).(character/numeric/logical/...)

# Lists & data.frames 
list

```


## Common data structures

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

## Statistics

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Ordering and tabulating 
duplicated, unique
quantile
sort

# Linear models 
fitted, predict, resid
lm, glm
I
anova, coef, confint

# Random variables

```

## Working with R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Workspace 
ls, exists, rm
getwd, setwd
source
install.packages, library

# Help
help, ?

```

## I/O
